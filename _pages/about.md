# About Me
Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) at Harvard University advised by [Professor Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Professor Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). My primary research focus is in building ML/AI systems applied to prevalent issues in the medical field. Currently I am investigating designing and evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for digital interventions.

Before coming to Harvard, I was a Technical Lead at Amazon, developing on backend, desktop, mobile web, and mobile app (native and react native) platforms for the configurable, contextual and personalized navigation experience for Wholefoods Market, Prime Now, & Amazon Fresh.
