# About Me
Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) at Harvard University advised by [Professor Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Professor Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). My primary research focus is designing and deploying reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for real-world systems.

Before coming to Harvard, I was a Technical Lead at Amazon, developing on backend, desktop, mobile web, and mobile app (native and react native) platforms for the configurable, contextual and personalized navigation experience for Wholefoods Market, Prime Now, & Amazon Fresh.
